HOW TO GET A WINDOWS EXE ? 
========================== 
 
1. Get a JAR (either you compile it or you download it), name it "skydocs-0.7.3-all.jar" and place it in this folder. 
2. Open "profile.xml" with launch4j (http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/) and compile it. 
3. Alternatively, you can use the following command : 
   java -jar "<Location of launch4j>\launch4j.jar" "profile.xml"
